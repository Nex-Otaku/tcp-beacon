## Features

 - Easiest TCP server ever
 - Sends out messages every second
 
## When to use it

Check that desired port is reachable from another host in two easy steps.

 1. Start dummy TCP server - TCP Beacon!
    ```
    tcp-beacon 9999
    ```
 2. Connect to server from client host, for example via [netcat](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) tool:
    ```
    nc my-server 9999
    ```
    
And now every second you will receive a message from TCP server, that appears immediately on screen.
